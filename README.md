We aim to understand how populations adapt to their environment, how they diverge into distinct species, and how these processes interact.

We combine empirical and experimental approaches to test fundamental evolutionary questions – such as how populations adapt to new environments or how demographic and ecological factors affect speciation – in a highly complementary fashion.

Current work in the group explores the questions above by focusing on the role of demography on speciation and adaptation – particularly, we want to know how small population size affects adaptation, persistence and divergence of species. Ongoing projects include:

Testing the effect of deleterious mutations (in small populations) on the evolution of reproductive isolation, combining comparative genomics of multiple evolutionary radiations in Lupinus with experimental speciation experiments in C. elegans;
Using comparative analysis of contemporaneous and historical samples to study long term trends in population size and adaptation related to ongoing environmental changes.
