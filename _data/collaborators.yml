  info: "I received a PhD from the University of Oxford in 1996, and I am currently Associate Professor in the University of Zurich.<br><br>I am interested in understanding the processes of evolutionary diversification across time and space, and in clarifying why some groups of organisms have more species than others; why some evolutionary lineages diversify more rapidly than others; what are the explanations for these imbalances in the Tree of Life; how does diversification differ between lineages in different biomes; and what can this tell us about historical assembly of biomes?<br><br>My work focuses on the legume family, one of the most spectacular examples of evolutionary success in the flowering plants and one of the most economically important groups of plants. Current work focuses especially on mimosoid legumes and the genus Lupinus as models for investigating plant diversification."

  info: "I received a Ph.D. in Environmental and Plant Biology from Ohio University in 2010, and I am currently the Senior Museum Scientist and Assistant Researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br><br>My research focuses on the taxonomy of several Malagasy groups (Malvaceae, Meliaceae, Polygalaceae), the diversity of Lupinus (Fabaceae) from Western North America, and the systematics of the Violaceae.  For the last several years I have led field studies to produce a floristic inventory of the Mesenia-Paramillo Reserve, a botanically unexplored cloud forest from the Cordillera Occidental in the Colombian Andes."
